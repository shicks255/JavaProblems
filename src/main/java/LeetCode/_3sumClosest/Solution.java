//https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/description/

//Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target,
// find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.
// Return the sum of the three integers.
// You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
//
//        Example:
//
//        Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.
//
//        The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
